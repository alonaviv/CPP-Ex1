This program receives a list of points from the user, and outputs the list of points that
constitute a convex hull.

The program is implemented, as required, with a Point object and a PointSet object, that holds 
points. The set uses a vector type array - a dynamic array that doubles in size every time
it maxes out. Thus most of the time the actual set takes up only a part of the allocated
array memory. The array holds pointers to Point objects. The objects are allocated upon adding
a point to the set, meaning the point holds its own copy of the points. This allows the
set to prolong the life span of the point object that is added to it.

In order to make the code extendable and reusable the entierty of the grahm scan algorithm,
used to determin the convex hull, is situated in the main program, and not in the 
aformentioned objects. The set objects allows sorting accorrding to a given boolean
function, or a given polar object. This object holds a static pivot, and allows a boolean
comparator function to use this pivot as data to detrmine the comparison. This 
functionality supports the polar sorting of the set as required by the algorithm, but
can be extended easily to any other sorting mechanism requiring a pivot point.

The set is overloaded with the requests operator, with pretty straightforward implementations.
It should be noted that the assignment operator is implemented with the swap paradigm, thus
utilizing both the copy constructor and the destructor in the assignment operations, without
duplicating code.
